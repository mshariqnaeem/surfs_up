# surfs_up Analysis

While on vacation at Hawaii we discovered a passion for surfing and decided to think of an idea to not only move to Hawaii; but also to live there self sustainably.
We thought of a fool proof idea for a Surf shop that serves the locals and tourists by selling both surf boards and ice cream + shakes.

We created a presentation to multiple investors and W. Avy a noteable investor is very excited about the idea and investing in the surf shop, however he has one major concern. The last shop he invested in did not take into consideration the local weather, and W. Avy wants some statistical analysis completed to make sure this idea will be successful taking into consideration the stormy nature of islands around Hawaii. This is where our statistical and data analytical skills come in and we decided to complete an analysis and show W. Avy the data to back up our idea.

## Overview of Statistical analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to show W. Avy that the Surf N'Shake shop is an amazing idea by also showing him statistical temperature data to ease his concerns regarding the natural weather patterns in the region. We completed this in our analysis results which is shown in our SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb file.

## Results

The results we calculated are for the following months of June and December which is shown in the 2 screenshots below.


As shown in the image below we see the count of results in June is 1700 records and only 1517 in December for the temperature records. This could be explained by certain stations having technical difficulties for the slight variance in results.\
That being said when we analyse the mean/average data temperatures from June and December along with thee minimum and maximum temperatures we see a maximum fluctuation of roughly 5 degrees farenheit which is quite stable and points towards a stable weather environment.

We created a seperate query to monitor the most active stations in June and December to further monitor the weather results and we came up with the following results shown in the charts below.
